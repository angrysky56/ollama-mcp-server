Advanced Research & Coding Agent

This script demonstrates a sophisticated fast-agent workflow that combines:
1. Research capabilities via arxiv-mcp-server
2. Code execution via mcp-code-executor
3. Data storage via chroma
4. Analysis via Ollama models

The agent can research topics, generate and execute code based on the research,
store results in a vector database, and provide comprehensive analysis.
