Code Execution with Ollama

This script demonstrates a fast-agent that combines:
1. Code execution capabilities from the mcp-code-executor server
2. LLM reasoning from Ollama models
3. File system operations to store and analyze results

The agent can write code, execute it, analyze the results, and improve the code iteratively.
